//Linear Search - recursive approach

//If the size of the array is zero then, return -1, representing that the element is not found. 
//This can also be treated as the base condition of a recursion call.
//Otherwise, check if the element at the current index in the array is equal to the key or
// not i.e, arr[size â€“ 1] == key
//    If equal, then return the index of the found key.

// Time complexity: O(N)
// Auxiliary Space: O(N)
